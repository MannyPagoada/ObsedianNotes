[NeetCode Video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OamzN90kPg)

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct  

 - we can do brute force by comparing every single number in the array
	 - O(N)
 - We could sort the array so that it can check to see if there is duplicates that are closer
	 - This will lower the time complexity because of the sort so O(nlogn)
- We could use a hashset that takes more space and be faster


	class Solution:
		def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
			hashset = set()
			
			for n in nums:
				if n in hashset:
					return True
				hashset.add(n)
			return False
