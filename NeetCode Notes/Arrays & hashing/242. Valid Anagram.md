Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise
- anagram needs to be the same size and have the same characters
- we are going to use a hash map - little more technical because have a key and answer 
	- use hash map to go through string and count letter occurrence and compare other string with it being hashed 


	class Solution:
		def isAnagram (self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
			if len(s)!=len(t):
				return False
			countS, countT= {},{}

			for i in range(len(s))
				countS[s[i]] = 1 + countS.get(s[i],0)
				countS[t[i]] = 1 + countS.get(t[i],0)

			​￼for c in counts:
				​￼if countS[c]!=countT.get(c, 0):
					return False

			return True
